# CSS385_Shred_Prototypes
This repository is for the ShadowSurfer Development team's game development project, Shred! 
The repository will contain the source code for the game prototypes developed with Unity. 
The prototypes will demonstrate the team's ability to develop the critical game components for Shred!

Ideally the Master branch for this project will contain a skeleton for the game's main menu UI. All 
main menu functionality will be disabled, but the scene will contain both the Main Menu 
background / artwork and the UI buttons (Ride, Shop, Mountain, Settings, and Exit). 

As prototypes are developed as seperate branches by individual developers they will be pulled to the
master with a functioning UI button in the Main Menu scene which loads the prototype scene. When this
project is complete it will contain the Main Menu scene with artwork, non-functioning UI buttons, and
funtioning prototype buttons which load the five different prototype scenes. The prototype buttons
will be the only difference between the final game's Main Menu scene and this project's Main Menu scene.

Four prototype scenes will be developed for this project: Finite Side Scrolling 2D Map, 2D Game Physics
with Gravity Controlled Speed, Player Control with Aerial Tricks and Landing Type Detection, and 
Particle Systems for Snowing Scenes and Snow Landing Reaction.
